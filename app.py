        This method is especially useful when used in conjunction with collections of user IDs returned from GET friends / ids and GET followers / ids.

        GET users / show is used to retrieve a single user object.

        There are a few things to note when using this method.

        You must be following a protected user to be able to see their most recent status update. If you don't follow a protected user their status will be removed.
        The order of user IDs or screen names may not match the order of users in the returned array.
        If a requested user is unknown, suspended, or deleted, then that user will not be returned in the results list.
        If none of your lookup criteria can be satisfied by returning a user object, a HTTP 404 will be thrown.
        You are strongly encouraged to use a POST for larger requests.

        user: A comma separated list of user IDs or screen names (as specified by the screen_names parameter), up to 100 are allowed in a single request. You are strongly encouraged to use a POST for larger requests.
